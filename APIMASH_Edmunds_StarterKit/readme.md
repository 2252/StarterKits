###Description
The Edmunds Starter Kit is a XAML/C# Windows 8 app based on the Blank Template that demonstrates calling the Edmunds REST API's. The JSON payload for Makes, Models, Model Specs and Pictures is deserialized into a set of C# classes that define the Data Model. That data then is selectively copied into the View Model for binding to WinRT XAML controls.
