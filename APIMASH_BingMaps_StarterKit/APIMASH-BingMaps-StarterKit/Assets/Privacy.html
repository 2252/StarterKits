    <p style="margin-top: 20px">Since this application makes use of the Internet Client capability to make calls to external services,
        you must have a privacy policy statement that is publically accessible. You will need host a page similar to this on
        a publically accessible site, perhaps using SkyDrive or Windows Azure, and supply the link to that page when you submit
        your application to the Windows Store.</p>
